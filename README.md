## Getting Started

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [\`create-next-app\`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

### First, run the development server:

\`\`\`bash
npm run dev

# or

yarn dev

# or

pnpm dev

# or

bun dev
\`\`\`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying \`app/page.js\`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [\`next/font\`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
